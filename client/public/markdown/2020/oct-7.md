Title: "Blogtober Day 7: Exams, Tools, and Names"
Date: October 7, 2020

It's midterm time!  I've already done two exams this morning, and I have two more tomorrow.  Thankfully, I

### Picking out my tools
Now that I have some requirements and a prototype of the most important pages, I need to figure out how to make it work.  

As I mentioned in a previous post, I want to use [WAILS](https://wails.app/) to package a [Svelte.js](https://svelte.dev/) client with a Go server.  I'll probably end up storing the data with [Gorm](https://gorm.io) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

For authentication, I really want to get a little more serious with my security.  I'm one guy, and I can't stay on top _every single_ vulnerability.  That's why I want to use [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/) for my authentication.  It's more convenient for users, and it'll let me sleep a little easier.

Now I have heard that actually implementing OAuth2 can be a pain, which is why companies like [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) can make a business out of wrapping it up in an easy-to-use wrapper.  However, I think it's important to be able to implement it myself.

### But what do I call it?
Now that I'm exiting the planning stage, I really need to come up with a name for my project.  Something related to the Theme System, but not married to it.  I would go with Theme Journal, but that already exists as a paper product.

Here's some spitballs:
- Theme Control
- Theme Note
- Theme Hub
- Theme Log
- Theme Core

And that's all I can think of right now.  I'd like to think of good word to use besides 'Theme,' but the close synonyms of theme do not really capture its meaning.

I'll think about it overnight, see if inspiration strikes.  That'll also be when I start building a codebase.

### Inktober Day 7
In mythology, dragons are awe-inspiring creatures of immense power.  Some were demons that laid waste to the land.  Some were powerful spirits who would offer sage advice to travellers of worth.

Some are like this guy.
