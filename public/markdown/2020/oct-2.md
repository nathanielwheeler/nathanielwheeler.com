Title: "Blogtober Day 2: Required Pages"
Date: October 2, 2020
---

Today, I've been thinking about the bare minimum pages I need to make a journal application.  

Obviously, you have your standard home view.  Then you have your user-related pages, like login, register, and profile/settings.

I'm thinking that home will simply be a product page that lays out all the features.  If the user is logged in, they should be redirected to their dashboard.

The dashboard should be a splash page related to whatever the user's theme is.  If the user has not done their daily themes and journal pages, it will have the forms for those.  If they have, it should show some analytics.]

I feel like the analytics will be one of the bigger features of this app, so I should have another view for some analytics information.

Aaaand that should be it for an MVP.  I'll make some more detailed requirements for the rest of the day, but I'm posting early today as my wife and I will soon be on the road to see my sister-in-law.  

This weekend, I will be making paper wireframes of what I want the site to look like.  I feel like this webapp will live or die by its look and feel, so I really want these wireframes hammered out.

### Inktober: Day 2

I did another Go gopher, but I did it in a slightly different style.  I also added a little color, because I couldn't resist.

Sadly, it has less crosshatching than I wanted, as I can only find my two smallest technical pens, meaning I may have to go out and get some new ones.
