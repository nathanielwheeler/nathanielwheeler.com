Title: "Blogtober Day 3: Saturday Shenanigans"
Date: October 3, 2020

Today, I went to the Craters of the Moon with some family and friends.  We lucked out and got an actual pro Vulcanologist to explain the finer details of the geology, which I was happy for.

Between travel, tours, and conversation, I did not actually get around to doing much in the way of prototyping, but I'm still thankful for the break in routine.  Nature feeds the soul, and I feel like invigorated by some brisk hiking and precious scenery.

Sadly, the whole valley is covered in a smoky haze, so a lot of my pictures didn't do the area justice.  Hopefully, next year has fewer fires.

### Inktober: Day 3

Today, I only had a sharpie, but I still did my best to do an adequate drawing of my sister-in-law's cat Lulu.

With that, I'm going to bed.
