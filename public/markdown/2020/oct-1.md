Blogtober is a month-long challenge to publish a blog post every day for the month of October.  When I realized this event was coming up, I knew that I had to commit for my fresh new blog.

So, for every day of October, I will be writing about the development of my latest project: implementing the [Theme System](https://www.thethemesystem.com/) as a web application.

What is the Theme System?  Instead of setting a yearly resolution into stone and giving up because you missed that one day, you can instead pick out a 'theme' for the year (or a season) that guides your endeavors.

For example, both of the creators have used the theme 'Year of Less', which translated to a year of less travel and fewer commitments for one, and no new projects for the other.

_If you're interested in a deeper explanation, co-creator CGP Grey made a video on the subject._

Implementing this system as a web application is something I have pondered ever since I heard of it last year.  I've been putting it off either because I believed I didn't have the skills or because life was too crazy to start a new project.

But now, I'm at a spot in life where I believe I can reasonably get this done.
