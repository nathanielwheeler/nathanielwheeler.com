Title: "Blogtober Day 4: Git Suffers No Fools"
Date: October 2, 2020
---

Today was a great day.  Brunch with family, dnd session, and a chill drive home.  My problems began when I came home and realized that I had _somehow_ pushed a bunch of old code into my master branch when I was working on my laptop.  After too much time trying to be fancy, I ended up going back and manually adding the relevant pieces back in.

One thing I've learned: I still have a lot to learn about git.

In any case, I'm going to have to make actual prototypes tomorrow in the comfort of my code cave, which will be a lot easier than trying to work amongst family.

### Inktober: Day 4

Tonight, I was exhausted.  I'm going to start doing these first thing in the morning, so I can actually focus on improving.
