Now that I have a blog in production, I've been asking myself what I should focus on for my next project.

While I am eager to get started on something new, I still have a lot of features I want to add to this blog before I focus my coding elsewhere.  Here's what's at the top of my list, in no particular order:

- A comment system for blog posts
- Email verification for new accounts, as well as password resets.
- Sign in with google or some other account verifier
- An RSS Feed

I'm still considering what to do after I've finished polishing this website.  I'd like to experiment with javascript frontends for a go backend.  I'd also like to make journaling app inspired by the [Theme System](https://www.thethemesystem.com/).
