# New Blog!
Hello the internet!  Welcome to the blog of me, Nathaniel Wheeler.

What is this blog for?  I'm glad you asked.  This is a blog for _whatever happens to hold my interest at the time of writing._  This could, potentially, be many things, but let's not initialize our chickens before they're defined, am I right?

Now, this blog was _supposed_ to be live way back in February.  Back in December of '19, I had just recently spent three months in an intense code camp learning C# and Javascript web frameworks.  I thought that I could learn another new language by myself in a similar length of time.

Needless to say, February came and went with no website to show for it.  And since March, I've moved towns, gone back to school, and learned what a pandemic is.  It might just be me, but I feel like this year has been a bit crazy!

Probably just me though.
